### CloudFrame
A foundational framework for creating and managing infrastructure solutions using modular and scalable configurations.

#### **Description**
CloudFrame aims to provide a simple yet effective approach to automating infrastructure deployment. Initially focused on projects within a single cloud provider, the framework leverages Terraform and YAML configurations for flexibility and reusability.

#### **Key Features**
- **Modularity:** Build solutions by combining reusable modules.
- **Simplicity:** YAML-based configuration for easy setup and customization.
- **Automation:** Streamlined deployment using Terraform.

#### **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vigntom/cloud-frame.git
   ```
2. Customize the `config.yaml` file to fit your project.
3. Apply the configurations:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

#### **Planned Enhancements**
- Expand module library for common use cases.
- Integrate monitoring and logging solutions.
- Refine and document best practices for infrastructure management.
